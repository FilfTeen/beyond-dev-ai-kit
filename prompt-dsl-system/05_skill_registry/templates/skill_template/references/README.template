# references/

Place reference documents for this skill here.

Rules:
- Files >100 lines MUST include a TOC at the top.
- Agent reads references via `read_refs: ["references/<filename>"]` in skill parameters.
- Use Progressive Disclosure: agent loads TOC first, then reads specific sections on demand.

Example structure:
```
references/
  domain_knowledge.md
  api_mapping.md
```
