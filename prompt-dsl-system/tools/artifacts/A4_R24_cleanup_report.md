# A4_R24_cleanup_report

## Workspace Hygiene
- No writes were made to external target project `repo_root` paths during development.
- New test fixture kept under kit repository only: `_tmp_structure_cases/case8_composed_annotation`.

## Generated/Updated Runtime Artifacts
- Regression outputs under `_regression_tmp/` were regenerated by validation runs.
- Existing dirty working tree state outside Round24 scope was preserved.

## Zero-Write Governance Verification
- Phase30 `status_index_zero_touch` PASS.
- Existing governance no-write checks remained PASS (Phase22/23/24/27/28/29).
